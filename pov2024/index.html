        <p>This presentation is designed to outline the structures that contribute to high rates of suicide in counties along the Tennessee border of Western North Carolina, as well as facilitate a larger discussion examining high rates of suicide among those in the LGBTQ+ community. In doing so, this presentation does not attempt to draw any concrete connections in the form of causation or correlation between the two topics. Rather, a shared space is given to both in order to propose further research to fill in the gaps that exist within the two spheres.  </p>

        <p>In the CDC’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), students are asked several questions in regard to their experiences within the last 12 months. Among these are questions related to feelings of sadness/hopelessness, seriously considering suicide, making a suicide plan, attempting suicide, and/or making a suicide attempt that required treatment. Results from these surveys have shown that while 5% of heterosexual/straight/cis-gendered students have attempted suicide, 23% of LGBTQ+ students have.<a href="sources.html" target="_blank">1</a></p>

        <p>The Southern LGBTQ Experiences Survey conducted by Campaign for Southern Equality and Campus Pride similarly asked questions related to mental health and suicide risk. Among the questions asked are those related to experiencing suicidal ideation or serious suicidal thoughts, attempting suicide, engaging in self-harming behaviors, engaging in disordered eating, self-isolating from support networks, and being hospitalized/staying in a mental health facility for safety reasons. Across the survey’s participants, 56.21% had experienced suicidal ideation, and 13.52% had attempted suicide.<a href="sources.html" target="_blank">2</a></p>

            <p>Data shows that many counties with the highest rates of suicide are found in the Appalachian region of Western North Carolina on the Tennessee border, including Cherokee, Swain, Mitchell, Ashe, and Avery. Nestled in the hollers of the mountains, isolated in small, rural towns, exist many structural barriers to health care. The following is a list of structures that contribute to Western North Carolina’s high suicide rates. </p>
